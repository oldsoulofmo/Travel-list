This is my first React project to push on Github.

`my-travel-list` is a small web app where you can list items you want to pack and check them after packing or delete them completely from the UI if not needed anymore. 

Also, this web app let's you sort your items based on three different choices. 

Finally, you can clear your list after finishing packing your items for your travel !
